# 1.Objective
The objective of this task is to review all installed web browser extensions, assess their permissions and credibility, identify any potentially malicious or unnecessary extensions, remove unsafe items, and document the entire process. This ensures better browser security, performance, and user privacy.

# 2.Browser Used
•	Google Chrome (Windows)
# Step 2: Review Installed Extensions
The following extensions were found installed:
1.	Adobe Acrobat: PDF edit, convert, sign tools
2.	Google Docs Offline
A screenshot was provided showing these extensions.
# Step 3: Check Permissions & Reviews
Both extensions were analyzed:
1. Adobe Acrobat
•	Publisher: Adobe (trusted)
•	Purpose: PDF viewing, editing, converting
•	Permissions: Standard for PDF tools
•	Reviews: Good (official Chrome Web Store extension)
2. Google Docs Offline
•	Publisher: Google (trusted)
•	Purpose: Offline access to Google Docs, Sheets, Slides
•	Permissions: Access to local files for offline editing
•	Reviews: Excellent
No red flags found.
# Step 4: Identify Suspicious or Unused Extensions
•	No unknown, unused, or suspicious extensions were identified.

# Step 5: Removal of Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions
•	Since both extensions are safe and commonly used, no extensions were removed.
(If desired, Adobe Acrobat can be removed, but it is not harmful and I want to keep it for my personal use.)

# Step 6: Restart Browser
Browser restart was noted as part of standard practice after extension management.


# Step 7: Research on Malicious Extensions
Malicious browser extensions can:
•	Steal personal data such as passwords and browsing history
•	Inject unwanted ads or pop-ups
•	Redirect users to phishing/malicious sites
•	Track keystrokes (keylogging)
•	Hijack active sessions (e.g., email, social media)
•	Slow down browser performance
This highlights the importance of regularly reviewing installed extensions.

# Conclusion:
My browser contains only two trusted extensions, both from reputable vendors (Adobe and Google).
No threats or suspicious activity were found.
Browser is currently safe, well-maintained, and secure.
